## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Grid layout
- Structuring a project using HTML & CSS and the general thought process by a pro dev
- CSS variables

### Continued development

The next step will be to refactor the code to use data dynamically from the .json file.

### Useful resources

- [From Design To Code - Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/KqFAs5d3Yl8) - This was really useful in showing how to setup these types of projects, which I will use going forward.

## Acknowledgments

This project was mostly coded by Kevin Powell but it allowed me to have a better understanding of the thought process that a professional developer has when starting projects from scratch.
